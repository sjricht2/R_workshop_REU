    "R is an integrated suite of software facilities for data manipulation, calculation and graphical display. It includes\n",
    "\n",
    "- an effective data handling and storage facility\n",
    "- a suite of operators for calculations on arrays, in particular matrices\n",
    "- a large, coherent, integrated collection of intermediate tools for data analysis\n",
    "- graphical facilities for data analysis and display\n",
    "- a well-developed, simple and effective programming language which includes conditionals, loops, user-defined recursive  functions and in-out and out-out facilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "The term \"environment\" is intended to characterize it as a fully-planned and coherent system, rather than an incremental accretion of very specific and inflexible tools, as is frequently the case with other data analysis software.\n",
    "\n",
    "--------\n",
    "\n",
    "Many users think of R as a statistics system. We prefer to think of it as an environment within which statistical techniques are implemented. R can be extended via packages. There are about eight packages supplied with the R distribution and many more are available through the CRAN family of internet sites, covering a very wide range of \"modern statistics\".\n",

    "1. Text editor: The simplest way to compose code is to use a text editor such as Notepad. The code can be saved as a file and then executed from inside the R console.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. R editor: From the file menu inside R, choose either *New Script* to compose new code, or *Open Script* to open saved code.\n",

    "- A window with tabs that allows you to show all files and folders in your default workspace, see all plots created, list and install packages, and access help topics and documentation\n",

    "### 2.4 Reading data into R\n",
    "In most situations, data will be stored in an external file that will need to be read into R. The **read.table** function is a general-purpose function for reading delimited text files. Suppose the data of the previous examples is contained in a text file called \"datafile1.txt\", arranged as below, with rows corresponding to observations:\n",
    "```\n",
    "2  \n",
    "5   \n",
    "8   \n",
    "9   \n",
    "9   \n",
    "10\n",
    "```\n",
    "Then to create the data frame, use the command:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Data <- read.table(file=\"https://www.uncg.edu/mat/qms/datafile1.txt\", header=F) \n",
    "Data\n",

    "Data\n",
    "```\n",
    "Now we may use functions to process the data. In the `read.table` function, the first argument is the specification of the location, `file=`, which is required. Next are two options, separated by commas. The first, `sep=\"\"`, specifies the delimiter, which in this case is a space, while the second specifies that the first row of the file does not contain variable name. If the first row contains the name of the variable, then add the option `header=TRUE` (or `header=T`).\n",
    "Note that all letters after the equal sign must be capitalized. Many other options can be specified in the `read.table` function (more on this later).\n",

    "Students in a statistics class at The University of Queensland participated in an experiment. First, the students measured their pulse rate. They were then asked to flip a coin. If the coin came up heads, they were to run in place for one minute, otherwise they sat for one minute. Next, everyone measured their pulse rate again. The pulse rates and other physiological and lifestyle variables are given in the data file. \n",
    "Five class groups between 1993 and 1998 participated in the experiment. After the first year, their arose a concern that some students chose the less strenuous option of sitting, even if their coin came up heads. Thus, in the years 1995-1998 a different method of random assignment was used: an equal number of students were randomly assigned to either running or sitting. In 1995 and 1998 not all of the forms were returned so the numbers running and sitting was still not entirely controlled.\n",
